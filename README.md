# Tracing Back to the Origins ðŸ§ 

This repository contains resources and analyses tracing the development of key foundational concepts in neural networks and deep learning. Each folder represents a significant model or theoretical contribution to the field, along with explanations, code, and other resources to facilitate understanding of these pioneering works.

## Getting Started

This repo contains detailed introduction and analysis for the monumental papers and important mathematical theorems throughout the development of artificial intelligence: [MP Neuron, Perceptron, Back-propagation, Cognitron, Neocognitron, Elman Network, NPLM, Universal Approximation Theorem]. Each folder contains resources specific to its topic, including theoretical explanations, code samples, and images where applicable. To explore a specific topic, navigate to the corresponding folder.

1. **Read the articles** in `articles_ENG` or `articles_CHN` for an overview and detailed explanations of each model or concept.
2. **Check and run the code samples** to exercise your muscles! (if available).
3. Feel free to use the slides or resources in the `images` folder!

Enjoy your journey! ðŸ§
